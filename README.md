# Project - Non-Profit Application
    
# Site Description 
    This application provides website for users to view non-for-profit organizations (NPOs) and NPOs to provide goals they would like to achieve to assist the community.  There is real life use application for this type of site.  User verification, organization vetting, and admin control are imperative to trust among the parties involved.  

# Technical Details
    The site uses the node.js, express.js, an MVC construct with Jquery code, Tailwinds for design, user registration and authentication to access the site, a database with users and organizational information connected with one user has many organizations, but an organization dose not have many users.  Handlebars manages the html and data interactions.

# AC Requirements
    These are the basic requirements for the creation of this project:

    Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
    Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.
    Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
    Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
    Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.
    Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
    Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
    Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
    Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
    Have a polished UI.
    Be responsive.
    Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
    Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions,    indentation, quality comments, etc.).
    Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

# Future Development
    Though the site is in a basic form, there are many more capabilities needed for users, organizations, and admins.  Future functions may include the following:
        -favorite capabilities for users
        -share function for social media
        -adding orgaizational data
        -search function for NPO types
        -admin function to approve users or organizations
        -link to a group fund share to disperse from our site
        -more duynamic interface
